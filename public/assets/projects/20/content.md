## Description

This was a Spigot plugin that allowed you to send messages to a player's "mailbox." This mailbox would store messages that were sent to the player while they were offline. The player could then read these messages when they logged back in.

It was a fun project. Then I got my first $10 USD donation and was commissioned to make a custom version of the plugin for a customer.

That verison of the plugin is closed-source and I emailed them the `.jar` privately.
