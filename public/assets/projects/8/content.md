## Description

CleanChoice was a project submitted to Schulich Hacks 2023. Me and my team were flown to University of Calgary on April 2023. We were given a weekend to complete a project that would help the environment.

Our project won 2nd place ($2k prize) and Best UI/UX ($1k prize)

CleanChoice generates a QR code on your receipt and scans the environmental impact of the products you've purchased.
