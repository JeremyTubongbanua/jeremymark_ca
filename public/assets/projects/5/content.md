# Climate Crusaders

## NASA Space Apps 2023

This was our submission for the NASA Space Apps 2023 Hackathon. Our project was called Climate Crusaders. The goal of our project was to raise awareness about climate change and how it is affecting our planet. We wanted to show people how they can make a difference and help combat climate change.

The project was written in Python and used the Pygame library to create a simple game.
