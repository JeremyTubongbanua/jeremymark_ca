# Creality K1 Mods

I bought the Creality K1 to continue doing more robotics projects but accidentally went down the rabbit hole of modding the printer itself. 3D printer prints parts for the printer haha.

All parts here are printed in PETG to avoid warping since it is an enclosed printer and can keep heat in quite easily.

## Chain Riser

First, is the chain riser which rises the chain which holds cables to the tool head. I also removed the PTFE tube from the cable chain because it was causing too much friction on the filament.

## Exhaust Filter

This mod holds a hepa filter (which you can see in the image) and a carbon filter behind it (which you can't see) to filter out the fumes from the printer.

## Exhaust Fan Cover

This mod prevents most filament from going into the exhaust fan

[This is another one that I would recommend](https://www.printables.com/model/588735-air-duct-for-the-rear-fan-of-the-creality-k1).

## Wider Auxilary Fan Guide

This mod guides the aux fan air to the entire print bed instead of just a small portion of it.

I also recommend this [one](https://www.printables.com/model/695783-quieter-auxiliary-fan-duct-for-creality-k1). I've had experience with it making the fan actually quieter. I was very impressed, but it did not guide the air throughout the whole build plate.

## Auxilary Fan Cover

This mod covers the aux fan to prevent filament from going into it.

## Magnetic Door Latch

Since I have 270 degree door, the door will attahc to the magnets on the left face of the printer.

## 270 Degree Door Hinges

There are lots of 270 degree door hinges for the Creality K1/K1 Max. But I like these because they are print-in-place (don't require supports) and they use gears as the hinges. All you need to do is purchase M3 screws from Amazon and these are pretty good. I still have them in PLA and they are still holding up well. I printed them in PETG as well as back up for when they break.

## Door Cover

Covers the door a little more

## Tool Drawer

Drawer under the printer to hold tools

## Lid Riser

This mod rises the lid so that the lid doesn't hit the PTFE tube. This is a common problem and a common mod for the Creality K1/K1C. It requires some M3x30 screws, so that's a bit annoying, but very worth it. The screws also keep the magnets feature of the lid.

## Lid Riser Betweeners

This mod is for the between parts of the lid riser. I printed 2 sets; 1 set with hexgons and 1 set that is flat and filled. I use the first set when printing with filaments that need more cooling like PLA and the second set when printing with filaments that need a warm enclosure.

I made [my own remix](https://www.printables.com/model/910819-remix-of-rear-betweeners-for-jck1-lid-riser) of the rear betweener because  the original did not fit my needs, and I no longer needed a bigger gap for the PTFE tube since it was going through the side.

The other betweeners came with the original [printables link](https://www.printables.com/model/770238-creality-k1k1c-hinged-lid-riser) with the risers.

## Lid Riser Back PTFE Hole

The back right lid riser is different and has a special hole for the PTFE tube.

## Lid Riser Stops

The hinge for the lid is very thin and wears out quickly. This mod adds a stop so that the lid riser doesn't slack back and holds it up right.

## Side Spool Holder

Holds the spool on the side instead of the back. Right now this is printed in PLA, which I gotta print in PETG cause it's warping lol.

## Filament Run Out Sensor

This is a remix of the printables link mentioned below. I removed all the rest of the supporting hands on it and it's a bit more flimsy, but it's perfectly fine to be honest.

This is a nice stand off for the filament run out sensor so that it aligns better with the spool of filament.

## Foot Locks

This mod holds the feet in place. Creality poorly designed this and expected us to just place the feet under so the printer sits on top.

## Bowden Tube Clips

This mod lets you remove your PTFE tube from the cable chain but still keep it in place to help guide the PTFE tube to the tool head.
