## Description

This is an IoT plant connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero. A web server is ran on the Raspberry Pi to serve as an API for the Twitch chatbot to interact with the plant. The Twitch viewers, everytime they follow, subscribe, or run the command, will run the 5V DC Waterpump to water the plant.

Schematics and code can be found in the [GitHub](https://github.com/JeremyTubongbanua/Bailey-x-Twitch)
