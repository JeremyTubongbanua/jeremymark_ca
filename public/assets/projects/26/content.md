## Description

noports is a company-wide project that aims to provide people the power to remote access their machines without having those machines to have open ports. It is a secure and easy-to-use solution that is perfect for people who are not tech-savvy. noports is a project that is currently in development and is not yet available for public use.

## My Contribution

- Wrote the at_c C SDK that is a core dependency of noports' C SSHNPD.
- Wrote the initial set of end-to-end tests using Docker that simulated the noports handshake process. Ports were closed on the Docker machines and simulated one Docker container SSH'ing into another.
